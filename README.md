# Relational and Graph Databases: A Comparison
This project investigates the strengths, weaknesses, and use cases of relational and graph databases. By utilizing PostgreSQL and Neo4j, the study evaluates their performance on a shared dataset containing articles, authors, and publication venues. Various queries, including joins, aggregations, and path traversals, were tested to determine the scenarios where each database type excels.

## Features
- Data Modeling: Comparison of relational (tabular) and graph (node-edge) data models.
- Query Performance: Evaluation of joins, aggregations, and graph-specific operations.
- Scalability and Flexibility: Analysis of each database's ability to handle large and dynamic datasets.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL: For relational database implementation.
- Neo4j: For graph database implementation.
- Python: For data preprocessing and query execution.

## Dataset
The dataset includes articles, authors, and venues, designed to fit both relational and graph database models. Key preprocessing steps included cleaning, normalization, and partitioning into entities.
